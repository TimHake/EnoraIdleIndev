Idle game. Allows player to preform various actions and activities through the UI, which will then be preformed in real time even if the program is closed. These actions will increase skills and grant rewards, allowing for progression through the game and access to more difficult content.

Current version has most base systems implemented and is ready for the majority of other content to be added. Only content in current version is UI examples, working inventory screen, and the ability to craft Iron Ingots. These features demonstrate the ability to handle all other non-combat activities with the current system.
